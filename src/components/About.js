				<p>
					I was a little girl! I obsessively watched and read <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, <em>Sarah Plain, and Tall</em>, <em>Love Comes Softly, </em>and really any other pioneering or homesteading movie and/or book series I could get my hands on at Blockbuster (#iykyk) or the local library. In fact, one time I saw on T.V. an ad for <strong>being paid</strong> to live, work, cook, and clean like a pioneer out West for like six months out of the year…and I was like “Mom, can I borrow your credit card and suitcase?”—that obviously ended in a no, but nonetheless you get my point. I’ve wanted to “homestead” for as long as I can remember.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I met my husband at church and he shared with me his love for land, gardening, canning, etc. I <strong>knew </strong>he was the one for me! Life hasn’t given us land, nor a farm yet…but while we wait we learn, we grow in our garden, we visit farms, we plan, and most importantly—<strong>we dream</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>I’m a Child of God, a wife, a mother, an educator, and a lover of writing and pretty things. I usually thrive somewhere around keeping my house in the state of “controlled chaos” and ready for hosting in 30 minutes if company is coming over. I love DIYing many things and go to natural remedies first before I pick up a medication or bandage. What you will read here are our failures, our dreams, our successes, our recipes and experiments, and the things that “work for us”—from #momlife to #gardenlife and everything in between.</p>
				<p>Natural. Resourceful. Authentic.</p>
				<p>Welcome to The Wirth Homestead!</p>
				<p>With love,</p>
